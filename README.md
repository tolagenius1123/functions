# Introduction to Functions 

Today we will be diving into the world of functions in JavaScript. Having gone through the basics of JavaScript from data types, conditional statements, and variables, we need functions to compute them, change them, and do something with them. 

This lesson is categorized into three segments for every concept of function we are going to learn, we will first start with the explanations, then move to demonstrations, where I will be showing you how to implement what you learnt before we finally move to exercises, here you will be given classwork to help you solidify the concept of functions you just learnt.

## What are functions ?
There is no way we can learn about functions without first defining them. We can think of functions as small computer programs although you may not realize it, you have been using functions this entire time. Functions allow us to write code that will be used over and over again, keeping our code DRY. 
DRY is a principle that ensures you do not repeat yourself when writing programs.

A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. Functions are the 
basic building block of JavaScript. Functions allow us to encapsulate a block of code and reuse it multiple times.
